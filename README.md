# HyperCreditsMenubar

A macOS menu bar application that displays your [Hyper (Charm)](https://hyper.charm.land) credit balance.

## Features

- ⚡ **Menu bar display** — shows `⚡{balance}` (e.g. `⚡42`) right in your menu bar
- 🔄 **Auto-refresh** — fetches your balance on a configurable interval (1m / 5m / 15m / 30m), and again on wake from sleep
- 📊 **Balance sparkline** — a subtle mini-chart in the popover shows your balance trend over recent fetches
- 📋 **Click-to-copy** — click the balance number in the popover to copy it to the clipboard
- 🖱️ **Right-click menu** — right-click the menu bar icon for quick access to Refresh, Open hyper.charm.land, and Quit
- 🔔 **Low-balance notifications** — alerts you when your balance drops below 10 credits, including on the very first fetch if you are already below the threshold
- 🔒 **Keychain storage** — your API key is stored securely in macOS Keychain
- 🎨 **Color-coded balance** — green (≥100), yellow (10–99), red (<10)
- 🔐 **Secure input** — API key field is masked
- 🚀 **Launch at login** — optional, using `SMAppService`
- 🔑 **Get key link** — quick link to [hyper.charm.land](https://hyper.charm.land) right next to the API key field
- 🫥 **Agent app** — no dock icon, no main window; lives entirely in the menu bar

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap ilyakooo0/tap
brew install --cask hyper-credits-menubar
```

Or in one command:

```bash
brew install --cask ilyakooo0/tap/hyper-credits-menubar
```

### Download the pre-built release

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ilyakooo0/hyper-credits-menubar/releases)
2. Download the latest `HyperCreditsMenubar-*.zip`
3. Unzip and move `HyperCreditsMenubar.app` to `/Applications`
4. Launch the app — it will appear in your menu bar as ⚡

> **Note:** Releases are **ad-hoc signed** — the CI build applies `codesign -s -` to the app, which gives it a stable code identity but is *not* an Apple Developer ID signature. macOS will still warn you on first launch: right-click the app → **Open**, or allow it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Removing that prompt entirely requires a paid Developer ID certificate and notarization.

### Set your API key

1. Click the ⚡ icon in your menu bar
2. Enter your Hyper API key (starts with `sk-...`) in the **API Key** field
3. Click **Save**
4. Your balance will appear immediately

You can get your API key from [hyper.charm.land](https://hyper.charm.land).

## Settings

Everything is configured from the popover — click the ⚡ icon in the menu bar.

| Setting             | Where                          | Notes                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **API key**         | **API Key** field → **Save**   | Stored in the macOS Keychain. Clearing the field and saving deletes the stored key.  |
| **Launch at login** | **Launch at Login** toggle     | Registers the app with `SMAppService`.                                               |
| **Notifications**   | System permission prompt       | macOS asks on first launch (only if not already decided). Required for low-balance alerts. |
| **Refresh now**     | **Refresh** button             | Forces an immediate fetch, on top of the automatic refresh.                            |
| **Refresh interval**| **Refresh every** picker       | Choose 1m, 5m, 15m, or 30m. Defaults to 5m. Stored in `UserDefaults` and persisted across launches. |

The app also refreshes automatically when your Mac wakes from sleep.

## How it works

1. **Menu bar item**: The app creates an `NSStatusItem` with a variable-length button showing `⚡{balance}` or `⚡?`. Left-click toggles the popover; right-click opens a context menu (Refresh, Open hyper.charm.land, Quit).
2. **Popover**: Clicking the menu bar item shows an `NSPopover` containing a SwiftUI `MenuView` with the balance, sparkline, API key field, and settings.
3. **API client**: `CreditsChecker` performs `GET https://hyper.charm.land/v1/credits` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, retries transient failures (5xx, timeouts) with exponential backoff, and decodes `{"balance": <int>}` (tolerating fractional values by rounding).
4. **Keychain**: The API key is stored/retrieved via `KeychainHelper` using the macOS Security framework. `save()` returns a `Bool` indicating success.
5. **Timer**: A `Timer` fires at the user-selected interval (1m / 5m / 15m / 30m, default 5m) to refresh the balance; the app also refreshes on wake from sleep. Changing the interval in the popover restarts the timer immediately.
6. **State**: `ViewModel` owns the balance, loading/error state, balance history (for the sparkline), refresh task (cancellable to prevent races), and the refresh interval, and is shared between the menu bar item and the popover.
7. **Notifications**: When the balance crosses below 10 credits — or is already below 10 on the first successful fetch — `ViewModel` posts a local `UNUserNotification`. Permission is requested only once.
8. **Agent app**: `LSUIElement=true` in `Info.plist` makes the app a background agent — no dock icon, no main window.
